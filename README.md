### Hi there!
⚡ I'm not an electronic engineer, I just couldn't afford real LEGOs so I play around with cheap modules, KiCAD and a soldering iron instead. I like designing PCBs of things I've seen, most of them I only build so that I would have one of them, the resulting files you'll find in the various repositories here. As for guarantees, there are none.

❓ If you have a specific question not directly related to a specific repository, check out [Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)](https://github.com/tebl/tebl/blob/main/faq.md). Depending on your question, I may have added some sort of hint somewhere in there.
