### Hi there!

ðŸ’¬ Iâ€™m not here right now, because this isn't actually a real place so leave a message instead! I may not respond instantly or at all - not because I do not want to, it's just that I don't have a lot of energy for all the things that life currently require of me. Just know that I wanted to.

âš¡ I'm not an electronic engineer, I just couldn't afford real LEGOs so I play around with cheap modules, KiCAD and a soldering iron instead. I like designing PCBs of things I've seen, most of them I only build so that I would have one of them, the resulting files you'll find in the various repositories here. As for guarantees, there are none.
