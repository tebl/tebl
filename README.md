### Hi there!
⚡ I'm not an electronic engineer, I just couldn't afford real LEGOs. Instead I play around with cheap modules, KiCAD and more often than not - a soldering iron. I like designing PCBs of things I've seen, most of them I only build so that I would have one of them, the resulting files you'll find in the various repositories here. As for guarantees, there are none.
