ðŸ’¬ Iâ€™m not here right now, because this isn't actually a real place so leave a message instead! I may not respond instantly or at all - not because I do not want to, it's just that I don't have a lot of energy for all the things that life currently require of me. Just know that I wanted to.


# FAQ
You probably have a lot of questions and while I sometimes appear to have them, they're usually a best-effort sort of thing. Electronics is not my day job, I actually don't one as I'm currently suffering from a chronic illness that severely limits my ability to function beyond basic day-to-day stuff. I dabble in electronics when I have the energy to do so, because everyone needs a hobby in order to keep an active mind healthy. I find that building simple things gives me a sense of accomplishment though it might not seem like much to actual EE-engineers.

The files made available through any of my repositories are free, but that does not mean that they come without any sort of limitations. Each repository will usually have a license associated with it if you want to know the specifics, but to keep things practical purposes - they're there because nothing in here comes with anything resembling a warranty. If you soldered it together, you take full responsibility for it (intended or accidental). If you connected it, ran it or powered it up - you're still responsible. I will however attempt to help you to the best of my abilities.

For anything else not answered up until this point, I've attempted to organize things into relevant sections below. Again, to the best of my abilities - which may at times be somewhat limited.

# 1> General
## 1.1> Why no response to my ticket?
As already mentioned, I do these things as a hobby while dealing with a chronic disease. I want to stay active in any way that I can, but unfortunately my ability to do so have been severely limited. There's no available midnight oil to burn, it has already been spent by the time I wake up in the morning. The good news however is that what I make is shared, you have all the resources available to figure things out.

## 1.2> How can I help?
There are many ways that you can help out with projects such as this, the easiest way is to just share your pictures and the fun you had building and using it - that's inspiring for aspiring hobby-tinkerers such as myself. If you find problems and have some bit of knowledge that you feel should exist somewhere within the repository, that is also a great way to contribute.

A PCB is cheap once it is ready for use, but there are usually several versions that never worked sufficiently - every time, I'm paying out of my own pocket to the PCB fabrication company, shipping and finally the import fees collected by the country that I reside in. For these three alone, a project usually is in the scale of a few hundred dollars. When ordering PCBs via projects that I've shared on [PCBway](https://www.pcbway.com/project/member/?bmbno=04C9EDC7-08B5-43), you can get one without dealing with most of the difficult questions as well so that I get a small discount on my next order.

If on the other hand, you'd like to buy me a cup of coffee instead - there's a button below for that stuff.

## 1.5> Can I sell these?
Yes, but only as long as you stay within the limitations of the license for the specific project. What that means is that I don't provide any warranties beyond it worked that one time I built one, also with my health the way it is - you should be prepared to support the products you sell. Please don't charge more than what can be considered reasonable for the amount of time and components that go into it.

If you'd like to support the project, consider contributing towards improving the projects with your experiences from doing so. I'd appreciate it if you ordered your PCBs via my [PCBway](https://www.pcbway.com/project/member/?bmbno=04C9EDC7-08B5-43), but I'll understand if you'd rather use your own favourite PCB fabrication company instead. If you earn a little from them, consider buying me a cup of coffee time to time.

# 2> Hardware
## 2.1> Can you build me one?
I unfortunately don't have the energy necessary to build more than my own prototypes, which is why they're available for *free* instead of being put on a web-shop somewhere. That's a good thing, it means you have everything I have so you can build as many as you'd like. At times there *may* be other people selling them, so consider asking on facebook groups related to the computer this project belongs to.

I take pride in doing simple things that anyone with access to decent tools should be able to build - using only the cheapest ebay parts. If someone is charging more than a moderate amount of money for them, I recommend you build it yourself - you'll enjoy it more as well.

## 2.2> Where can I get the PCBs?
- You can ask in your favourite facebook group, in particular those that specificly discuss vintage computers, to see if someone happens to have extras. Not everything I make will be related to a vintage computer, but that is mostly the types of designs I enjoy working on.
- You can order them from [PCBway](https://www.pcbway.com/project/member/?bmbno=04C9EDC7-08B5-43), you'll find them as shared projects - usually they will be my last known good designs (repositories may contain untested features). Each repository will usually have links pointing these out, so you don't need to spend all that time finding all of them (many of my projects require a set of PCBs).
- You can have them produced used the Gerber-files found within this repository, usually what they'll want is a zipped-up copy of the files found within each projects *export* directory. Fill in the options you need, what you'd need is two-layer PCB though there might be a few different values you'd need to fill in correctly.

## 2.5> Where's the BOM?
The BOM (*Bill of Manufacturing*) is the list of components needed to build a project, so where on earth did I put it? That depends on your definition of what a BOM should look like. I unfortunately can't afford the rather extreme import and shipping costs associated with ordering from mouser, digikey and the other various professional sites, so I can't provide you with the specific part numbers for those sites (mainly as I wouldn't have the ability and knowledge to verify their suitability). They mostly only sell quality parts, but as it stands I simply can't afford them.

The parts I use instead primarily come from sources such as ebay, aliexpress or banggood. Not exactly known for being particularly detailed when it comes to sales listings or even quality in some cases, but on the other hand they're cheap and you'll usually find an extreme amount of listings for the parts used with little to no difference between them. What I then call a BOMs should therefore be more considered as a collection of search queries, then you'd need to compare the pictures to see if the listing matches what has been used. This does lead to some open questions, this is unavoidable, but usually you could order a couple of different options for a modest amount of money.

## 2.6> It doesn't work, why doesn't it work?
I try my best to make my designs easy to build, but that doesn't mean everyone's guaranteed success on their first attempt at building one. All is definitely not lost though, what you've earned is the perfect chance to learn more than you've bargained for. Start by doing a visual inspection, check that every components that have a polarity (meaning that they go in a certain way) is in the same orientation as can be seen in the pictures. Look for jumpers that are missing, pins you've forgotten to solder or simply accidentally bridged.

With all of the easy stuff out of the way, now comes the time that you'll need to learn how to decipher a schematic. A schematic is a logical representation of how the components should function together, but given the time you shouldn't have any issues once you spend a little time looking at them. A pro tip I always recommend is to print it to paper, then highlight accordingly as well as noting down your findings along the way. Most of my designs are simple and should for the most part be easy to follow using a multimeter, it should be easy to isolate the problem to a specific area.

If all of that fails, you could always open a ticket here on github.
