# FAQ
You probably have a lot of questions and while I sometimes would even appear to have answers to all of them, they're usually a best-effort sort of thing. Electronics is not my day job, and to be honest I currently don't even have one. What I do have, is a chronic illness that severely limits my ability to reliably function beyond basic day-to-day stuff. When I have the energy needed to do so, I tend to dabble in electronics. Everyone needs a hobby in order to keep an over-active mind healthy, and I - build things that provide me with a sense of accomplishment. Ultimately it might not seem like much to actual EE-engineers, because it usually isn't. My actual background in electronics was a single chapter covered in some physics classes that I once took. That's the kind where you do a lot of mathematical problems, not the kind where you do a lot of running around while trying to look sporty! What can I say, other than state that I had a great teacher (though probably not in English).

The files made available through any of my repositories are provided free, but that does not mean that they come without any sort of limitation. Each repository should have a license associated with it, that details how that works - in excruciating detail. Read through it if you want to know the specifics, but in order to keep things somewhat practical - they're there because nothing that I've ever made available to you, have ever come with anything even resembling a warranty. If you built it, then you take full responsibility for what it does (both intended or accidental). If you connected it, used it in any way or powered it up - you're still responsible. I will however attempt to help you, to the best of my abilities.

For anything else not answered up until this point, I've attempted to organise things into relevant sections below. Again, to the best of my abilities - which may at times be somewhat limited.

# 1> General
## 1.1> Why is there no response to my ticket?
As already mentioned, I do these things as a hobby while dealing with a chronic disease. I want to stay active in any way that I can, but unfortunately my ability to do so have been severely limited. There's no available midnight oil to burn, it has already been spent by the time I wake up in the morning. The good news however is that what I make is shared, you have all the resources needed to figure things out. Chances are that a printed out schematic, a little elbow-grease will often lead to an actual answer before I ultimately manage to write up a reply that would more than likely be little else than questions intended to narrow things down the fault within the confines of the same schematic.

## 1.2> How can I help?
There are many ways that you can help out with projects such as this, the easiest way is to just share your pictures and the fun you had in building and using it - that's inspiring for aspiring hobby-tinkerers such as myself. If you find problems and have some bit of knowledge that you feel should exist somewhere within the repository, that is also a great way for anyone to contribute.

A PCB is cheap once it is ready for use, but there are usually several versions that never worked sufficiently. Each and every time, I'm paying out of my own pocket to the PCB fabrication company, shipping and finally the import fees collected by the country that I reside in. These three alone amounts to several hundreds of dollars without counting the parts themselves, and that's for each project that got as far as being made available to you. This isn't to say that all of my projects are worth something to everyone, but it is more to say that I often trade away owning expensive things to do this kind of thing.

One small thing that will help yet won't actually cost you anything at all, is using [PCBway](https://www.pcbway.com/project/member/?bmbno=04C9EDC7-08B5-43) when ordering one of my many shared projects. That'll provide you with a set of PCB that I know should work, going directly to the repositories will allow access to potentially newer versions of files that I might not have had the time or resources to test.

If on the other hand, you'd like to buy me a cup of coffee instead - there's a button below for that stuff.

## 1.3> Are you on YouTube?
Yes, but only to a limited degree as editing videos often take away from the things I enjoy the most - building things. For that reason the type of content I create will for the most part serve as parts of documentation, but I would love a subscription for my [channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TEBLify). It is my hope that it may at some point become large enough to qualify for some sort of sponsorship, but that does not appear likely.

## 1.4> Can I share it on YouTube?
As already mentioned in [Are you on YouTube?](https://github.com/tebl/tebl/edit/main/faq.md#13-are-you-on-youtube) I have a [channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TEBLify), it has videos that were made to serve as documentation rather than focus on editing and, well, general presentation. I would love it if you were to make a video sharing something that I've had a hand in designing, I'm  convinced that you can do a significantly better job at presenting it! While I do stumble across such videos from time to time, it is somewhat strange to accidentally do so, several months after the rest of the audience have seen it.

Please include a link to my channel if you are able to, but for the viewers in general - a link to the specific GitHub-repository is probably helpful. If only so that people will be able to find their way to the latest available set of documentation.

## 1.5> Can I sell these?
Yes, but only as long as you agree to stay within the limitations of the license supplied with the specific project. That's pretty much it. While I don't expect you to sit down and read the whole things, they're not really riveting entertainment - my short summary of the licenses that I  tend to use, is mostly that I do not provide any warranties of any kind. At least beyond it having worked out that one time I built one for myself. Considering the fact that this would make you the seller, you should be prepared to support the products you sell - I probably won't be able to do it for you. As for pricing I can't dictate what you would charge for something, therefore I state a wish that you don't charge more than what can reasonably be considered appropriate for the amount of time you spend building it, as well as the cost of components consumed along the way.

If you'd like to support the project, consider contributing towards improving the projects with your experiences from doing so. I'd appreciate it if you ordered your PCBs via my [PCBway](https://www.pcbway.com/project/member/?bmbno=04C9EDC7-08B5-43), but I'll understand if you'd rather use your own favorite PCB fabrication company instead. If you earn a little from them, consider buying me a cup of coffee from time to time.

## 1.6> What's with the humor?
Many may think it quite unprofessional to include strange humorous quirks in technical documentation, but to the I only have a singular response:

May I remind you that I'm not a professional. Writing documentation that almost no-one will ever read for an open personal project, will inevitably take a bit of weirdness in order to sanely make it all the way to the end. You're welcome!

# 2> Hardware
## 2.1> Can you build me one?
I unfortunately don't have the energy necessary to build more than my own prototypes, which is why they're available for *free* instead of being put on a web-shop somewhere. That's a good thing, it means you have everything I have so you can build as many as you'd like. At times there *may* be other people selling them, so consider asking on Facebook-groups related to the computer this project belongs to.

I take pride in doing simple things that anyone with access to decent tools should be able to build - using only the cheapest eBay parts. If someone is charging more than a moderate amount of money for them, I recommend you build it yourself instead - you'll enjoy it more as well.

## 2.2> Where can I get the PCBs?
- You can ask in your favourite Facebook-group, in particular those that specifically discuss vintage computers, to see if someone happens to have extras. Not everything I make will be related to a vintage computer, but that is mostly the types of designs I enjoy working on.
- You can order them from [PCBway](https://pcbway.com/g/G6LK96), you'll find them as [shared projects](https://www.pcbway.com/project/member/?bmbno=04C9EDC7-08B5-43) - usually they will be my last known good designs (repositories often contain untested features). Each repository will usually have links pointing these out for you, so you don't need to spend all that time finding all of them (many of my projects require a set of PCBs). If you have extras, why not ask on your favourite Facebook whether someone wants one? 
- You can have them produced using Gerber-files, these can be found within the *export*-directories in many of my repositories. If they're not there, see [Where are the Gerbers?](#23-where-are-the-gerbers)

## 2.3> Where are the Gerbers?
Gerber-files isn't the file format used when working on creating a PCB-design, they are a set of files that can be generated from the design software when you are ready to send the off to a PCB fabrication company such as PCBWay, JLCPCB etc. While I've included them as part of the repositories at earlier points in time, this led to issues where I would still be working on new changes that were not yet completed - yet - people would order things using them. For that reason they are no longer a part of the repository.

If you know what you're doing, at least in terms of being comfortable enough to download the KiCAD-files and generate them yourself - then I'm going to assume that you probably know what you're doing. That may sound scary to a lot of users that only want to practice soldering, but I include links to [shared projects](https://www.pcbway.com/project/member/?bmbno=04C9EDC7-08B5-43) on [PCBWay](https://pcbway.com/g/G6LK96) so that you should have an easy way to order without having to think about all that. This way I also know that the version you're ordering, is one that I've tested.

If neither is available, for some reason or another, leave me a message.

## 2.5> Where's the BOM?
The BOM (*Bill of Manufacturing*) is the list of components needed to build a project, so where on earth did I put it? That depends on your definition of what a BOM should look like. I unfortunately can't afford the rather extreme import and shipping costs associated with ordering from mouser, digikey and the other various professional sites - so I couldn't even begin to provide you with specific part numbers for those sites. The reason is simply that I wouldn't be able to verify that they are correct. While they sell quality parts, I simply can't afford "quality" parts - so I make due with what is more readily available to me.

The parts I use instead primarily come from sources such as eBay, AliExpress, banggood or that other one, the one with the spinning prize wheel. None of these alternatives have been known for being particularly detailed when it comes to sales listings or even quality in some cases, but on the other hand they're cheap and you'll usually find an extreme amount of listings for the parts used with little to no difference between them. What I then call a BOMs should therefore be more considered as a vague collection of search queries, then you'd need to compare the pictures to see if the listing matches what has been used. This does lead to quite a bit of open questions, that's certainly unavoidable, but usually you could order a couple of different options for a modest amount of money. It may seem daunting at first, but usually they're all mostly the same thing and the more common of them is the one I've used.

So where did I put it then? They're usually listed as part of the README for each project, when there are multiple designs as part of a repository you'd need to click the specific folder in order to find one that is specific to it.

## 2.6> It doesn't work, why doesn't it work?
I try my best to make my designs easy to build, but that doesn't mean everyone's guaranteed success on their first attempt at building one. All is definitely not lost though, what you've earned is the perfect chance to learn more than you've bargained for. Start by doing a visual inspection, check that every components that have a polarity (meaning that they go in a certain way) is in the same orientation as can be seen in the pictures. Look for jumpers that are missing, pins you've forgotten to solder or simply accidentally bridged.

With all of the easy stuff out of the way, now comes the time that you'll need to learn how to decipher a schematic. A schematic is a logical representation of how the components should function together, but given the time you shouldn't have any issues once you spend a little time looking at them. A pro tip I always recommend is to print it to paper, then highlight accordingly as well as noting down your findings along the way. Most of my designs are simple and should for the most part be easy to follow using a multimeter, it should be easy to isolate the problem to a specific area.

If all of that fails, you could always open a ticket here on GitHub.
